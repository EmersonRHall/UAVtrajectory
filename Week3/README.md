This is week 3 of the research.  
This code sets up a simulation environment for unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory testing using MATLAB’s UAV Toolbox. The environment includes a ground plane, a thin wall, and a square block as obstacles, with a quadrotor platform executing a waypoint-based mission. The UAV ascends, navigates along the wall, passes through a gap, flies around the block, and descends to its final position.
The simulation runs with a kinematic waypoint tracker that limits the UAV’s velocity to 1.2 m/s and checks a tolerance for waypoint completion. Visualization is provided through 3D rendering, showing the UAV’s movement and leaving a trajectory trail. At the end of the mission, the simulation confirms successful navigation with the “Mission Complete” message.
This environment forms the foundation for testing more advanced trajectory planning and optimization approaches in later project phases.
