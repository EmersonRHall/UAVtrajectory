This is week 10 of the research.  
This week expands off of Week 9. There are multiple UAVs within these demos. Within the code, change the value of NU to the amount of UAVs desired. The yellow arrow in the top left corner represents the wind direction while the speed of the wind is shown in the title. Attached is a google drive with demos from this week.
