This is week 9 of the research.  
Week 9 goes through the process of the UAV becoming better with navigating through different obstacles. First, I began with getting the UAV through the same, stationary obstacles with one moving obstacle elbaorating off of Week 6 data. Once the UAV became consistent, I moved on to getting the UAV to be able to navigate through the still and moving objects. The UAV consistantly avoided the objects so I create a random layout of the still objects and one moving object. The UAV for the most part can navigate through these objects. There are still some hiccups.   
There is a google drive attached that shows the various demos. Within the final folder, theres 4 videos: 2 showing the UAV dodging still objects and 2 showing the UAV dodging a moving object.
