This is week 8 of the research.  
This code evaluates the ridge regression model trained in Week 7 and improves it through systematic hyperparameter tuning. The ridge coefficient is swept across a logarithmic scale to identify the value that minimizes validation RMSE. The tuned model is then assessed on training, validation, and test sets using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, cosine similarity, and a strict success rate metric.  
The results show that the tuned ridge model reproduces UAV velocity actions with negligible error and perfect directional alignment. Validation and test success rates remain above 80%, with performance limited only by strict numerical tolerances. Scatter plots and validation curves confirm the stability of the model and the accuracy of its predictions.  
This evaluation establishes that the ridge regression baseline closely matches the original A* trajectory planner in controlled environments. It also highlights the modelâ€™s limitations in generalization, motivating the transition to reinforcement learning methods for handling new and dynamic scenarios.
