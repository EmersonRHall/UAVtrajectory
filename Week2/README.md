This is week 2 of the research.  
This week defined the UAV trajectory optimization problem in detail, including decision variables, hard and soft constraints, and objectives such as minimizing time, energy, and path length while maximizing safety and reliability. The project was formulated both as a classical optimization problem with weighted objectives and as a reinforcement learning task with states, actions, transitions, and rewards.
The report also outlined a dataset plan using simulation-generated episodes with static maps, moving obstacles, and wind conditions. Expert planners such as A* and RRT* provide baselines for supervised learning, while reinforcement learning agents will learn from reward signals. The dataset will be split into training, validation, and test sets, with preprocessing steps like normalization, standardized maps, and data augmentation to support robust model training.
