This is week 12 and the final week for the research.  
Week 12 focused on running full-system validation across all terrains, wind profiles, and controller modes, then integrating the findings into the final report and presentation. This week completed the experimental pipeline and produced the final evaluation of both the baseline and machine-learning controllers.
