This is week 7 of the research.
This code trains an initial supervised model on the preprocessed UAV trajectory dataset created in Week 6. The task is formulated as a regression problem where the model predicts velocity components from sixteen engineered features that describe UAV state and environmental conditions. Both ordinary least squares regression and ridge regression are implemented for comparison.
Ordinary least squares fails due to singularities in the dataset, while ridge regression achieves perfect accuracy across training, validation, and test sets. The ridge model exactly reproduces the velocity actions from the baseline planner, with zero error and cosine similarity of one. The code outputs metrics, saves predictions, and generates scatter plots and error histograms that confirm the perfect fit.
This work establishes a behavior cloning baseline and verifies that the dataset and feature engineering pipeline are consistent. It provides a reference point for future reinforcement learning approaches that will test generalization in more complex and dynamic environments.
